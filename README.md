# Topic-Modeling-Comparation
Analyzing Indonesian EV news from kompas.com using LDA, NMF, and GSDMM topic modeling. Identifying best method for coherent topic clustering, aiding EV discourse insights.

In the context of analyzing an Indonesian language dataset, this study focuses on a collection of news titles sourced from the prominent online news portal kompas.com. The dataset exclusively pertains to news articles related to electric vehicles (EVs). The primary objective of this research endeavor is to unveil the prevalent themes and subjects conveyed within the realm of electric vehicles through these news titles.

The dataset is meticulously curated to encompass a comprehensive array of news headlines, all centered around the overarching theme of electric vehicles. The Indonesian language is at the heart of this dataset, capturing the nuances and intricacies of the language used in news reporting. The data, sourced from the reputable kompas.com news portal, reflects a diverse range of EV-related topics as covered by the news outlet.

To extract meaningful insights and uncover the latent themes, the study employs sophisticated topic modeling techniques, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Mixture Model (GSDMM). Each of these methods is fine-tuned to optimize its performance on the Indonesian language dataset.

The research undertakes a comparative analysis of the outcomes produced by these topic modeling methods. By evaluating the coherence and relevance of the generated topics, the study aims to discern which method best captures and clusters the underlying themes within the EV-related news titles. The ultimate goal is to identify the method that aligns most closely with human judgment, effectively distilling the intricate web of topics present in the news titles into coherent and interpretable clusters.

Through this comprehensive exploration and methodological comparison, the study contributes valuable insights to both the field of electric vehicle discourse and the broader domain of natural language processing. It sheds light on the prevalent themes surrounding EVs in the Indonesian context while also advancing our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of different topic modeling techniques in analyzing textual data in this language.
